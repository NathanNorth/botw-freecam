# Breath of the Wild Freecam

FORKED FROM [etra0](https://github.com/etra0/botw-freecam) -'S AMAZING WORK. I have no clue how rust works so I'm not going to try and pollute thier codebase with my garbage.

This is a BOTW Freecam. Simply run it and it should work.

Tested with Cemu 1.22.2 and Breath of the Wild v1.5.0 DLC Ver.3.0 (**Support for other versions is not assured**)

**WARNING: If you close the console it'll close the game. Press HOME to close it.**

**This tool can be flagged as a virus, check https://github.com/etra0/botw-freecam/issues/17**

**If you run Cemu as admin, you **must** run the tool as admin as well.**

**If your CPU is pre 2016, this tool may not work for you right now**
